Consider this, nature is intricately complicated yet so simple and orderly. It is the perfect representation of "Simplicity on the other side of complexity". This order we observe - explained by rules such as those of genetics - map disorder to order

In my own life, I strive to embrace disorder,to  enter the forest of disorder and evolve through it. I believe that in the grand scheme of things, I will emerge as a beautiful representation of order, just like nature itself.
