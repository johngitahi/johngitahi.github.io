I am reminding myself that the best way to live is to stay focused on my goals. I have been rudderless for the past two years â€” not because I had no set goals or did not work on my goals, but because I was careless with how I executed plans. Especially the short-term goals. It is a sad realization which has been difficult to confront.

 To make it more relatable, I have been lacking in discipline. It comes to the basics:
 - waking up(99% of the time not according to plan), 
 - how I would manage time(99% of the time I couldn't finish a plan without distraction)
 - not covering up for missed/adjusted plans.

These things are simple, yet in the long run, that is, the deadline of goals set become very important determiners of whether the goal will be met or not met. For me, goals cannot be partially met. A goal is either met or not met.

### Moving forward
And so with this realization, I am challenging myself to be careful and strict, remembering to observe the "simple" determiners of goal attainment. Maybe memorizing the goals I have now and the "determiners of goal attainment" is a good first step.

I choose to end this piece of writing with this quote from *Crime and Punishment*, reminding me to not lose sight of the goals/moral code I have set:

> Your worst sin is that you've destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing
