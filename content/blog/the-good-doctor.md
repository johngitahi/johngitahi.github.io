As a student nurse during clinical rotations, I am beginning to gain a deeper appreciation for the profound nature of healthcare. I am beginning to understand that medicine is a calling that demands devotion. When I become a doctor, I'll need to approach my work with an almost sacred dedication, knowing my decisions will directly affect patients lives in the long-term. This means my medical judgements must be well-informed and logical.

My ultimate goal will be to serve patients by reducing their suffering and improving their health and prognosis. To me this commitment to patient well being is the hallmark of a good doctor.
